Technical requirements

To ensure a smooth learning experience throughout this book, it's essential to have the necessary technologies and installations set up. This section outlines the technical requirements for working with Python and relevant libraries.
All technical requirement related to this chapter are shared in the book’s GitHub URL below under ch8 folder: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Options-Trading-with-Python-/tree/main/ch8.
The installation of Python, Anaconda, integrated development environments (IDEs), and package managers, as well as the creation of the “mboptions” environment, has already been covered in Chapter 4. You can install all the necessary packages listed in the requirements file as follow:

Once Python and pip are set up, you'll need to install the libraries needed for this chapter if they are not installed yet. The library versions installed for this chapter along with Python version 3.11.7 are as follows:
pandas 2.2.2
pytz 2024.1
numpy 1.26.4
matplotlib 3.8.4
python-dateutil 2.9.0.post0
To install the necessary libraries for your Python script, you will need to use either pip or conda. The installation process was covered in detail in Chapter 4.
Here is a list of the libraries and their purposes, along with the necessary import statements:
# import Lib
import pandas as pd            # Data manipulation and analysis
import datetime as dt          # Date and time manipulation
import pytz                    # Time zone calculations
import os                      # Operating system interfaces
import numpy as np             # Numerical operations and array manipulations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt# Plotting and visualization
import scipy.stats as si       # Statistical functions
import math                    # Mathematical functions
import networkx as nx          # Creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks
import tensorflow as tf        # Machine learning and neural networks
import xgboost as xgb          # Gradient Boosting Machines for regression and classification

# import module
from datetime import datetime, timezone  # Date and time manipulation with timezone support
from datetime import date, time          # Date and time manipulation
from math import trunc                   # Truncate floating-point numbers

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error        # Metrics for evaluating model performance
from scipy.optimize import brentq                     # Root-finding algorithm
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D               # 3D plotting
from scipy.interpolate import griddata                # Interpolation of scattered data
These libraries and modules are essential for various aspects of financial modeling and machine learning tasks covered in this chapter. They facilitate data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning model building, and visualization, enabling efficient and precise calculations of implied volatility and option pricing.
With these technical requirements in place, you're now ready to dive into the world of options pricing using Python. As you progress through the book, you'll gain hands-on experience and practical skills by working with these powerful tools and libraries.
Let's move on to introducing the implied volatility in the next section.
