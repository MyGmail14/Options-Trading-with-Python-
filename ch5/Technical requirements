Technical requirements

To ensure a smooth learning experience throughout this book, it's essential to have the necessary technologies and installations set up. This section outlines the technical requirements for working with Python and relevant libraries.
All technical requirements related to this chapter are shared in the book’s GitHub URL below under ch05 folder: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Options-Trading-with-Python-/tree/main/ch5
The installation of Python, Anaconda, integrated development environments (IDEs), and package managers, as well as the creation of the “mboptions” environment, has already been covered in Chapter 4. You can install all the necessary packages listed in the requirements file from Chapter 4, as we will be using the same libraries, with the exception of the yfinance library.

Libraries needed for this chapter and installation
Once Python and pip are set up, you'll need to install the libraries needed for this chapter if not installed yet.
The libraries versions installed for this chapter along with Python version 3.11.7 are as follow:
•	pandas             2.2.2
•	pytz               2024.1
•	numpy              1.26.4
•	matplotlib         3.8.4
•	python-dateutil    2.9.0.post0

To install the necessary libraries for your Python script, you will need to use either pip or conda. The installation process was covered in detail in Chapter 4.

Loading needed Libraries and modules
For this chapter, we'll initiate our Python code by first importing the necessary libraries and modules, as outlined below:

# import Lib
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt
import pytz
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as si

# import module
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from datetime import date, time
from math import trunc
from dateutil.parser import parse


With these technical requirements in place, you're now ready to dive into the world of options pricing using Python. As you progress through the book, you'll gain hands-on experience and practical skills by working with these powerful tools and libraries.
