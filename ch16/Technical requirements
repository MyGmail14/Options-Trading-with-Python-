Technical requirements
To ensure a smooth learning experience throughout this book, it's essential to have the necessary technologies and installations set up. This section outlines the technical requirements for working with Python and relevant libraries.
All technical requirement related to this chapter are shared in the book’s GitHub URL below under ch16 folder:
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Options-Trading-with-Python-/tree/main/ch16

For detailed descriptions of the below four topics, please refer to the Technical Requirements section in Chapter 4.:
•	Python and Anaconda installation 
•	Integrated development environments (IDEs)
•	Package manager
•	Creating the “mboptions” Environment
•	Libraries needed for this chapter and installation

Loading needed Libraries and modules
For this chapter, we'll initiate our Python code by first importing the necessary libraries and modules, as outlined below:

# import Lib
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import gymnasium as gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# import module
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense
from stable_baselines3 import A2C
from stable_baselines3 import PPO


With these technical requirements in place, you're now ready to dive into the world of options pricing using Python. As you progress through the book, you'll gain hands-on experience and practical skills by working with these powerful tools and libraries.
