Loading needed Libraries and modules
For this chapter, we'll initiate our Python code by first importing the necessary libraries and modules, as outlined below:
# import Lib
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt
import pytz
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as si

# import module
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from datetime import date, time
from scipy.optimize import minimize

With these technical requirements in place, you're now ready to dive into the world of options pricing using Python. As you progress through the book, you'll gain hands-on experience and practical skills by working with these powerful tools and libraries.
