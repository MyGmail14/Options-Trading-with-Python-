Technical requirements

In this introductory chapter, we focus on the technical requirements to get you started with the GitHub repository for this book, which can be accessed at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Options-Trading-with-Python-. This repository includes Jupyter notebooks and flat file data to support your learning.
To explore options pricing with Python, it's essential to set up a well-configured development environment. This includes installing Python and selecting an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that suits your preferences. In Chapter 4, you'll find detailed instructions on installing Python and choosing an IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook. These IDEs enhance the coding process with features for writing, debugging, and executing code.
Since we will be using Jupyter notebooks throughout the book, it's beneficial to have Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook installed. We recommend using Anaconda, a Python distribution tailored for data science and machine learning, which simplifies package management and virtual environment handling. It includes IDEs like Jupyter and Spyder for interactive coding. Creating virtual environments is crucial to ensure you use the same library versions as we do, ensuring the code runs smoothly. Instructions for creating a virtual environment will be provided in Chapter 4.
